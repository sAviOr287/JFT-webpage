## Bio üìñ
<p align="justify">
I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Bytedance Research in London, focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs). My research interests lie in Reward Modelling and Multi-Agent LLM systems. I defended my DPhil in Machine Learning at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof. Yee Whye Teh and Prof. Dino Sejdinovic. Prior to my DPhil, I completed my MSc in Applied Statistics at Oxford and BSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London.

My previous research focused on Kernel Methods, Meta-learning, Bayesian Optimization, Uncertainty Quantification and Responsible AI. I have gained valuable industry experience through internships at Amazon in T√ºbingen, Germany, Apple Inc. in Cupertino, CA, and Bloomberg L.P. in London.
